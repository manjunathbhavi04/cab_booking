# Enums are by default int
when we a enum as a attribute in an entity that attribute is stored as a integer in the mysql database
so we have to manually set the datatype by @Enumerated(value = EnumType.STRING) above the enum attribute in the entity class

# foreign keys
foreign keys are always created at many means
customer to booking has a cardinality of one to many where one customer can have many bookings so the foreign key
is created at booking table as customer_id

# cardinalities for entities
customer and booking one to many
driver and booking one to many
driver to cab one to one

# application.properties default code
spring.datasource.url = jpa:mysql://localhost:8080/db_name
spring.datasource.username = root
spring.datasource.password = root@123
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update or create or any ddl

# why use interface instead of class for repository
we create a interface for entity repository because interface can inherit a interface but a class can only implement a interfcae this means
that if we use a class then we have to implement the methods in JpaRepository
